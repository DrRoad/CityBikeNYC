location. As a result, these problems might be solved more effectively, using data driven decisions.

Two simultanious maps are created in order to have an opportunity to

As you can see, this file does contain the output to the code. This is called a "data-driven document" because you can include the code and output together to make analysis easier to understand, audit, and reproduce.
