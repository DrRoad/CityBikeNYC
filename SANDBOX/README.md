Here is a place to put code you are working on currently.

# TO DO:

1. Create pseudo-code to describe the project steps for creating a map similar to the Flowing Data example using the January 2015 data.

```
write steps here
```


2. Update Project Documents

* Add some useful descriptive statistics to the DATA readme file. For example, number of trips by user, most common routes, most common times to travel, etc.
* Add a tutorial to the webpage in the docs folder.



3. Create Visualization of Trips (ADVANCED)

Work through the animation tutorial.

Select a day in January and create a GIF to visualize bike trips throughout the day.
