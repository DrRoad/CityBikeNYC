# Setup

Add this code to set global options. Always initialize all of your packages up-front. **(Professor J. Lecy)**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=F, message=F, fig.width=10)

library( dplyr )
library( ggmap )
library( tibble )

```



# Load Data

```{r}

# Upload and analyze dataset
# bikes <- readRDS("bikes.rds")
bikes <- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://github.com/lecy/CityBikeNYC/raw/master/DATA/bikes.rds")))

str(bikes) # 285552 rows
summary(bikes)
names(bikes)

```



# Attempt 1 (with dplyr)


**Here I use dplyr package, deleting 13 columns and leaving only three - ID, start station longtitude and 
start station latitutide. The idea was to create two dataframes (the same one for end stations), then
merge them into one dataframe by ID. I did it, but it looks like it messed up frequency of rides in every #root (frequency was multiplied by frequency - for instance, 20 rides in one root transformed into 400 rides**


```{r}


# Deleting all columns besides start station lat and long
# Start station

start.station <- bikes %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(tripduration = NULL, starttime = NULL, stoptime = NULL, start.station.id = NULL,
         start.station.name = NULL, end.station.id = NULL, end.station.name = NULL, 
         end.station.latitude = NULL, end.station.longitude = NULL, bikeid = NULL, usertype = NULL, 
         birth.year = NULL, gender = NULL)
head(start.station, 10)


# Deleting all columns besides end station lat and long
# End station

end.station <- bikes %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(tripduration = NULL, starttime = NULL, stoptime = NULL, start.station.id = NULL,
         start.station.name = NULL, start.station.latitude = NULL, start.station.longitude = NULL, 
         end.station.id = NULL, end.station.name = NULL, bikeid = NULL, usertype = NULL, 
         birth.year = NULL, gender = NULL)
head(end.station, 10)



# Merge data (long and lat columns for start and end station by id)
bikes.merged <- merge(start.station, end.station, by="ID")
head(bikes.merged, 10)

head(table(table(bikes.merged$ID)), 10)
# 1       4     9    16     25    36    49    64    81    100 
# 12932  6848  4400  3182  2355  1899  1543  1264  1162   983




# Group and summarize data 
bikes.merged1 <- bikes.merged %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(n = n())




# unique(bikes.merged1)
# ID     n
# <chr> <int>
# 1  116-116   400
# 2  116-127   100
# 3  116-128     1
# 4  116-147    16
# 5  116-151    16
# 6  116-153   169
# 7  116-157     1
# 8  116-160     9
# 9  116-167     1
# 10 116-168  1600
# ... with 44,063 more rows


```







# Attempt 2 (with dplyr)

**Another approach - not to merge two dataframes, but create the only one with dplyr. I deleted 11 columns
with dplyr, but left five ones - ID, start station long and lat, end stat long and lat. I think this option is
more reasonable. I do not need to merge dataframes, complicating the task and messing data.**



```{r}


stations <- bikes %>% as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(tripduration = NULL, starttime = NULL, stoptime = NULL, start.station.id = NULL,
         start.station.name = NULL, end.station.id = NULL, end.station.name = NULL, bikeid = NULL, usertype = NULL, 
         birth.year = NULL, gender = NULL)

head(stations, 10)




bikes2 <- stations %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(n = n())


# A tibble: 44,073 ï¿½ 2
# ID     n
# <chr> <int>
#  1  116-116    20
# 2  116-127    10
# 3  116-128     1
# 4  116-147     4
# 5  116-151     4
# 6  116-153    13
# 7  116-157     1
# 8  116-160     3
# 9  116-167     1
# 10 116-168    40
# ... with 44,063 more rows





head(table(table(stations$ID)), 10)

```
